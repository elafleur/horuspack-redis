### The ratio of memory used as seen by the operating system to memory allocated by Redis.
A fragmentation ratio greater than 1 indicates fragmentation is occurring. A ratio in excess of 1.5 indicates excessive fragmentation, with your Redis instance consuming 150% of the physical memory it requested. A fragmentation ratio below 1 tells you that Redis needs more memory than is available on your system, which leads to swapping.
